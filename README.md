# Psychic-Game
### I will think about functions the JS will execute 
- I want there are 4 variables showing on the screen: 
    1. Wins
    2. Losses
    3. Guesses Left
    4. Your Guesses so far

- Create a list for computer Choice(the list include 26 letters)
- Make sure that even the user press a upper case letter, it will convert to a lower case letter
- When user guess same as computer guess, I win
- When user guess not same as computer guess, then the user will loss a chance of guess(the user total have 12 times for guessing)
- When user lose all 12 times of guessing, the user loss


###Technology I use:
- HTML
- Javascript
